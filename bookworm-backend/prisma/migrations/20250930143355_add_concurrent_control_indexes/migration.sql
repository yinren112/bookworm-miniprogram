-- Migration: Add Partial Unique Indexes for Concurrent Control
-- Purpose: Enforce database-level constraints to prevent race conditions
--
-- Background:
-- The system uses a two-table reservation pattern:
-- 1. PendingPaymentOrder: Enforces one pending order per user
-- 2. InventoryReservation: Tracks inventory → order mapping
--
-- This migration adds an additional constraint to prevent inventory items
-- from being referenced by multiple incomplete OrderItems.

-- Critical Note: PostgreSQL partial unique indexes with WHERE clauses
-- can only reference columns in the indexed table itself, not joined tables.
-- Therefore, we rely on application-level transaction logic combined with
-- the existing InventoryReservation table's unique constraint on inventory_item_id.

-- Verification: The InventoryReservation table already enforces this at line 107:
-- inventory_item_id Int @id (Primary key = unique constraint)
-- This means one inventory item can only have ONE reservation at a time.

-- Since Order → InventoryReservation is a one-to-many relationship,
-- and InventoryReservation.inventory_item_id is unique (PK),
-- the database already prevents one inventory from being in multiple orders.

-- What we ADD here: Make it explicit in OrderItem for query optimization
-- This is a redundant safety check and helps PostgreSQL query planner.

-- Safety constraint: Ensure OrderItem's inventory_item_id uniqueness
-- when the parent order is incomplete
-- Note: We cannot directly query Order.status in the WHERE clause of an index on orderitem,
-- so this index serves as documentation. The real enforcement is via:
-- 1. InventoryReservation.inventory_item_id (PRIMARY KEY)
-- 2. Application-level transaction that inserts both atomically

-- For now, we add a comment-only migration acknowledging the existing constraints
-- are sufficient. If needed, we can add trigger-based enforcement later.

-- Summary: No SQL changes needed. Constraints are already enforced by:
-- ✓ PendingPaymentOrder.user_id UNIQUE (line 41 in schema.prisma)
-- ✓ InventoryReservation.inventory_item_id PRIMARY KEY (line 107 in schema.prisma)
